    "The last three are for exercise 2. These are recursive versions of various math functions. The first, \"power\" is a tail recursive function for calculating a value x raised to some power n. It is tail recursive because it uses an accumulator. The second function is also recursive but not tail-recursive. It does the same thing, but calculates it by continuously splitting down the n value into halves until it reaches one, then multiplies them all. The final function recursively generates a 'binomial coefficient' out of two values 'n' and 'k'. These values can be understood to be row/column identifiers of Pascal's triangle."
